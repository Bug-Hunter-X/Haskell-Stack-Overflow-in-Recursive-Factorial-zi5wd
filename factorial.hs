This Haskell code attempts to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion. However, it has a subtle bug that leads to a stack overflow for larger inputs:

```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```

The problem is that Haskell's lazy evaluation doesn't automatically optimize tail recursion.  The recursive call to `factorial` isn't in a tail position, meaning it's not the last operation performed. This creates a chain of function calls that grows with the input, eventually exceeding the stack limit.
